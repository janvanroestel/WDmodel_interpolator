# WDmodel_interpolator
An interpolator for Koester DA white dwarf models. The models should be 
downloaded from here: http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/newov/
The interpolator uses the filenames to get the T and logg from the model,
so don't change the filenames (this needs to be changed at some point...)
